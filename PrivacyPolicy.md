This Privacy Policy explains how [Bot Name] ("the Bot") handles user data.

1. Data Collected
- Discord User IDs, Guild IDs, Channel IDs.
- Verification records, logs of suspicious or fraudulent activity, and other moderation-related data.
- Data provided during verification (e.g., IP addresses, account linkage, or other identifiers, if applicable).

2. Purpose of Data Collection
- To verify users and manage access to servers.
- To investigate fraud, cheating, or abuse.
- To maintain order and security in participating communities.

3. Data Sharing
- Data is not sold or shared with third parties.
- Data may be shared only with server administrators and moderators for enforcement purposes.

4. Data Retention
- Data is retained as long as necessary for server regulation, fraud prevention, and community security.
- We do NOT offer user-controlled deletion or access to data, as this would undermine the integrity of investigations and moderation.

5. Security
- Reasonable measures are taken to secure data.
- However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

6. Your Acknowledgment
- By using the Bot or being part of an official Lucid City discord, you understand and agree that your data may be collected and stored for moderation and security purposes.
